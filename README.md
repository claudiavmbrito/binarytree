# binarytree
This is the Java implementation of Binary Tree. Not Binary Search Tree.

For the insert method. I try to make tree as a complete binary tree or full binary tree.

I also implement tree deep first searchs (pre-order, in-order and post-order) and breadth first search.

The pre-order traveral not only use recursive implementan, but also use while loop implementation.
